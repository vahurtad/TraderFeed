1. asset amount - has to be within range, check balances
   
    set_Double_Sided_Order
2. percentage threshold - threshold to determine when to switch between stop loss order and target order,
 using ticker. This adds threshold to menu.

3. use bestAsk to optimize target order - if ticker >= original target and if ordered not executed then 
    (if spread > .01, make target = bestAsk - .01 else target = bestAsk ) 
    else order should have been executed

4. remove ticker price - ticker price is not necessary to optimize?

5. add threshold as decimals to menu item
----------
6. added validate to threshold for decimals > 1
7. added validate for asset amount to all or a number, not letters
----------
8. check entry price if its .01 lower than smallest ask 
9. added default balue for threshold is .73
10. need trigger for order filled
