1. asset amount - has to be within range
   
    set_Double_Sided_Order
2. percentage threshold - threshold to determine when to switch between stop loss order and target order, using ticker

3. use bestAsk to optimize target order - if ticker >= original target and if ordered not executed then 
    (if spread > .01, make target = bestAsk - .01 else target = bestAsk ) 
    else order should have been executed
4. remove ticker price - ticker price is not necessary to optimize

5. add threshold as decimals to menu item
